ALSO ALL AI, BUT I NEED TO HAVE Direction


# What Files to Write First – Multiplayer IO Game

This guide tells you **exactly which files to write first**, in order, and *why*.
It is designed for an APCSA student building a Canvas + Node.js + Socket.IO game.

---

## Phase 0 – Absolute Minimum (Day 1)

### 1. client/index.html
**Purpose:** Entry point for the game.
- Creates the `<canvas>`
- Loads your JavaScript

Nothing runs without this file.

---

### 2. client/main.js
**Purpose:** Client main method.
- Gets canvas + context
- Starts the game loop
- Draws one moving shape

Goal: See *something* move on the screen.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Game Loop (Day 1–2)

### 3. client/game/game.js
**Purpose:** Game loop controller.
- update()
- render()

Equivalent to a `while(true)` loop in Java.

---

### 4. client/game/player.js
**Purpose:** Player class.
- position (x, y)
- velocity
- update logic
- draw method

This should feel very familiar from APCSA.

---

## Phase 2 – Player Input (Day 2)

### 5. client/input/keyboard.js
**Purpose:** Capture keyboard input.
- Listen for key presses
- Store movement intent

Do NOT move the player here.

---

## Phase 3 – Multiplayer Basics (Day 3)

### 6. server/index.js
**Purpose:** Start the Node.js server.
- Initialize Socket.IO
- Log connections and disconnects

No gameplay yet.

---

### 7. client/network/socket.js
**Purpose:** Client-server connection.
- Connect to server
- Confirm connection works

---

## Phase 4 – Shared Truth (Day 4)

### 8. shared/constants.js
**Purpose:** Shared configuration.
- Player speed
- Sizes
- Tick rate

Prevents magic numbers.

---

### 9. server/game/player.js
**Purpose:** Server-side player class.
- Authoritative position
- Movement logic

Server becomes the referee.

---

## Phase 5 – Real Multiplayer Movement (Day 5–6)

### 10. server/game/gameLoop.js
**Purpose:** Server heartbeat.
- Fixed tick rate
- Update players
- Send state snapshots

---

### 11. client/network/handlers.js
**Purpose:** Receive server updates.
- Update local player
- Update other players

Interpolation comes later.

---

## Minimal Starter File List

If you want the smallest possible setup:

client/
- index.html
- main.js
- game/game.js
- game/player.js

server/
- index.js

shared/
- constants.js

---

## APCSA Translation

- main.js → `public static void main`
- player.js → Player class
- game.js → Game controller
- server → Teacher grading the game rules

---

Build in this order. Do not skip ahead.
