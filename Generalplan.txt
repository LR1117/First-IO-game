NOTE THIS IS MOSTLY AI, Just the inishal file structure and what each file is going to do. 


# 📁 General Project File Tree (HTML5 Canvas + Node.js + Socket.IO)

This is a **clean, scalable file structure** for a Narwhale.io-style multiplayer web game. It separates client and server clearly and leaves room to grow.

---

## 📦 Root Directory

```
multiplayer-io-game/
│
├── client/                 # Front-end (browser)
├── server/                 # Back-end (Node.js game server)
├── shared/                 # Code shared by client & server
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

---

## 🎮 Client (Front-End)

Everything the player downloads and runs in the browser.

```
client/
│
├── index.html              # Main HTML entry point
├── main.js                 # Boots the game: sets up canvas, connects socket, starts loop
│
├── canvas/
│   ├── renderer.js         # Draws players, world, effects onto the canvas
│   ├── camera.js           # Handles world-to-screen offset (player-centered view)
│   └── layers.js           # Controls draw order (background → players → UI)
│
├── game/
│   ├── game.js             # Core client game loop (update + render)
│   ├── player.js           # Client-side player model (position, rotation, state)
│   ├── world.js            # Client-side world data (map size, boundaries)
│   └── collision.js        # Client-side prediction + simple collision checks
│
├── input/
│   ├── keyboard.js         # Keyboard event listeners (WASD / arrows)
│   ├── mouse.js            # Mouse movement + aiming logic
│   └── touch.js            # Touch controls for mobile (optional)
│
├── network/
│   ├── socket.js           # Creates Socket.IO client connection
│   └── handlers.js         # Responds to server messages (spawn, update, death)
│
├── ui/
│   ├── hud.js              # In-game UI (score, leaderboard, minimap)
│   ├── menu.js             # Start menu, respawn screen
│   └── overlays.js         # Popups, kill messages, alerts
│
├── assets/
│   ├── images/             # Sprites and textures
│   ├── sounds/             # Sound effects and music
│   └── fonts/              # Custom fonts
│
└── styles/
    └── style.css           # Page styling (menus, overlays)
```

---

## 🧠 Server (Back-End)

This is the authoritative game engine. Clients do not decide truth.

```
server/
│
├── index.js                # Server entry: starts Socket.IO + knowing game loop
├── config.js               # Tunable values (tick rate, max players, speeds)
│
├── game/
│   ├── gameLoop.js         # Fixed-timestep server loop (physics + updates)
│   ├── world.js            # Stores all players and world state
│   ├── player.js           # Server-side player object (truth source)
│   └── collision.js        # Real hit detection and validation
│
├── network/
│   ├── socket.js           # Socket.IO server setup
│   └── handlers.js         # Handles join, input, disconnect, hit events
│
├── rooms/
│   ├── room.js             # Single match instance
│   └── roomManager.js      # Creates, destroys, assigns rooms
│
├── utils/
│   ├── math.js             # Vector math, angles, distance
│   ├── ids.js              # Unique player / room IDs
│   └── timers.js           # Tick timing helpers
│
└── logs/
    └── server.log          # Debug / error logs
```

---

## 🔁 Shared (Client + Server)

Keeps math and constants identical on both sides.

```
shared/
│
├── constants.js            # Speeds, sizes, damage values
├── vector.js               # 2D vector math class (add, normalize, rotate)
├── collisionShapes.js      # Standard hitbox definitions
└── protocol.js             # Socket message names ("playerMove", "stateUpdate")
```

---

## 🧾 Root Files Explained

```
package.json                # Dependencies & scripts
README.md                   # How to run the project
.gitignore                  # Ignore node_modules, logs
```

---

## 🧭 How Data Flows (Mental Model)

```
Input → Client → Socket.IO → Server
Server → Physics → Collision → Snapshot
Snapshot → Socket.IO → Client → Render
```

The server is the referee. The client is the illustrator.

---

## 🚀 Beginner-Friendly Starting Point

If this feels big, start with just:

```
client/
  index.html
  main.js

server/
  index.js

shared/
  constants.js
```

You can grow into the full structure as features appear.

## 🧩 Next Steps I Can Help With

* Minimal working prototype using this structure
* Explain **each folder’s responsibility** in detail
* Create starter code for `client/main.js` and `server/index.js`
* Convert this into a GitHub-ready repo

Just say the word and point where you want to dive in.
